# Lisp9 Implementation

This repository is the source code from [t3x/lsi](https://t3x.org/lsi/).

The book explains the implementation of an interactive Lisp system. Source of the original implementation from the book is available from the above link.

This repository contains my implementation, probably in Rust, notes etc.
