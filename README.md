# Lisp9 Implementation

Rust implementation from the book [t3x/lsi](https://t3x.org/lsi/).

The book explains the implementation of an interactive Lisp system. Source of the original implementation from the book is available from the above link.

### Background

The book [Lisp System Implementation](https://t3x.org/lsi/) is a tour through LISP9, a LISP bytecode compiler and interpreter. 

I wanted to revise Rust, thus this repo contains the C implementation ported over to Rust.

Still in progress ...
